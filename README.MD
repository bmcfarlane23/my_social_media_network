# MY SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK
#### My goal in the project is to make an application that connects Flask, PostGresSQL, and PGadmin. 
#### I will be using a REST API for a social media network. The entry points will include profiles, posts, comments, and images. I want to have a web application that outputs a json of the current entries into the database for profiles, posts, comments, and images.
